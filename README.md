# Automated Library Gneration and Serendipity Quantification enables Diverse Discovery in Coordination Chemistry

This work accompanies the paper Kowalski, MacGregor, Long, Bell, and Cronin, *Hybrid Human-Robot Laboratories enable Library Generation and Discovery in Coordination Chemistry*, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2022.

Code is split into two sections (with individual README.md files): `code_TOS_focused`, which deals with the work discussed in the sections 'Key Synthetic Operations for Coordination Chemistry' and 'Focused Library Generation', and `code_prospecting`, which deals with the work discussed in the sections 'Prospecting Library Generation' and 'Deconvolution of MS Data from the Prospecting Library'.

No further development is planned at this time.
