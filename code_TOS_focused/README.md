# Automated Coordination Chemistry

Contains scripts for the automated preparation of a number of coordination complexes using a Chemputer/ChemPU. Parallelized generation of a library of ruthenium bipyridyl complexes is also included.

This work accompanies the paper "Hybrid Human-Robot Laboratories enable Library Generation and Discovery in Coordination Chemistry", by Kowalski, MacGregor, Long, Bell, and Cronin.

No further development is planned at this time.

## Dependencies
Required packages and versions. May require their own dependencies.
* ```python``` -> 3.7.1

Running the script requires bespoke libraries designed to permit interfacing and operation with the Chemputer/ChemPU, along with the versions used:
* ```Chempiler``` -> 2.0.9
* ```ChemputerAPI``` -> 2.0.dev0
* ```chemputerxdl``` -> 1.0.0
* ```commanduinolabware``` -> 0.1.0
* ```SerialLabware``` -> 2.0b1
* ```xdl``` -> 0.5.0
